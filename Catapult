/* 
Using a Servo Motor (SM-S2309S) 
to make a "catapult" throw 6 so called spheres
(read: tennisballs covered in velcro) at a Mammoth

This code will make a servo: 
Pick up one ball and throw it, go back to start position, pick up next ball x 6

GROUND: Black wire: ground
POWER: Red wire: 5 V
SIGNAL: White wire: pin 9, we need to use PWM

need to include the servo library
